#Tic_Tac_Toe

#The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic paper pencil game which is played between two players. The game is played on a 3X3 grid, and each player takes turn to fill the grid. The first player to form a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally will be the winner.
#This is a python based game in which two players have been declared as 'player 1' and 'player 2' and the grid is based on the numeric keypad present in the keyboard. The game announces which player has won otherwise a Tie is declared.
